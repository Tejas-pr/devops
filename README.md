# DevOps Learning Journey 🚀

This repository contains my personal DevOps learning journey, experiments, and practice projects.

## What's Inside

- **Kubernetes** - Manifests, deployments, services, and ingress configurations
- **Docker** - Dockerfiles and docker-compose setups
- **Monitoring** - Prometheus configurations and monitoring applications
- **Applications** - Various backend and frontend applications for testing deployments
- **Infrastructure as Code** - Kubernetes manifests and configuration files

## Structure

- `k8s-manual-ingress/` - Kubernetes manual ingress configurations
- `ingress-week36/` - Ingress controller experiments
- `docker-compose/` - Docker Compose setups
- `bms/` - Monorepo with multiple applications
- `prometheus/` - Monitoring and observability
- `files/` - Kubernetes configuration files

## Learning Goals

Exploring containerization, orchestration, service mesh, monitoring, and cloud-native technologies.
